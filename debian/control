Description: Additional ifupdown scripts for configuring network devices
 This package includes the following scripts extending the ifupdown system
 with useful features. All scripts are configured through additional statements
 in /etc/network/interfaces and integrate nicely:
 * addresses
     allows multiple addresses to be added to an network device
     in a convenient CIDR notation
 * reachable
     add additional networks reachable through a configured interface, either
     directly or by using a connected gateway
 * conflicts
     automatically (de)configures an interface when another one comes up
     or goes down
 * pan
     connects your computer to an Bluetooth PAN access point
     before configuring the interface
 * vpnc
     controls a cisco VPN connect through ifupdown
 * wireless-tools-snooze
     waits for association with the access point before retrieving
     an IP address for the wireless network
 * ifupdown-network
    pm-utils script that shuts down specified network devices during
    suspend and restores them during resume
